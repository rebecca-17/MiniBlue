    What I contributed: I implemented the shake input which displays the score for 3 seconds and then returns player to game play. I also made the game end after 8 gems are collected, and the created the code that creates the border.

    What I contributed: I converted the scroll code into the our current code, and using it to make Mini Rebecca move (The blue square). I added the code and checks to ensure Mini Rebecca does not move out of the border. I created the code that 
    make gems and the code to search for gems. 

Instructions:
    To start the program simply place on a flat surface ensuring the rasberry PI is not moving than start the program via 
    make run
    complies and runs the program 

    control mini Rebecca (The blue square) using the joystick moving her to the gems (The green squares) once you are on top of the gems simply click into/press down on the joystick to collect the gem. After each succesful search a new gem will spawn, after 8 gems are collected the game will end.

    To check how many gems you have simply shake the rasberry, each green line represents a gem collected. 

    Addition commands:
    make all -> complies the file
    make clean -> removes the compiled files
    ./project -> to run the game
